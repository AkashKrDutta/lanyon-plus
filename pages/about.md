**Hi!**<br>
First of all, thanks for considering your time worthy for my introduction ! I am Akash Kumar Dutta, a second year undergraduate from IIT Kanpur. So many things to say about my self but, well I am total blank writing things right now, whatever I write next down will be a mind walk.<br>

**Why this site?**<br>
Well I didnt wanted to write about my self in the first place. I love to do <code>competitive programming</code>, <code>web dev</code>, <code>game dev</code> and <code>parallel programming </code>. But something was lacking in my build up, which every coder one day or the other soon realises, it was expressing how they felt what they took pride in doing ! Not only expressing but sometimes you get to know a special idea that, something that you want to share, but with whom? So this one is just the outcome of that. If you are reading this, thanks a lot mate!<br>

**What to look for?**<br>
If you are interested in my blogs, want any help regarding the topics, or want to discuss the out-of-box topics, I am forever ready to help you in the discussion. Morever, I will try my best to keep this updated so that you get to know things better about me and my doings.
<br>
Disclaimer- I really like anime, gaming and so many things ! So this site isnt only going to have tech related blogs !<br>

**What you can do?**<br>
Well you can discuss about the posts in the disqus threads, if you are interested or contact me if any kind of help needed. I got my inspiration reading blogs of my seniors, so if you dont have your one and like to share your thoughts this, is the place !<br>

**About me finally...**<br>
Not letting emotions run over, I am from Tatanagar, Jamshedpur. I had my education for Jamshedpur Public School and landed up at IIT Kanpur after clearing JEE. (THE exam in India (sarcasm meant :P) ). The journey till now ... well I can say was just amazing, and really doesnt deserves this place to be written ! I will cover up the journey in one of my blogs soon enough, so you get to know about what is the life of an engineer :P and the trolled life of an IITian. Lets hope you really find something interesting or useful in here. In case, please feel free to comment !
