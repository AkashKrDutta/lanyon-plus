title: Poisson Equation Solver in CUDA
category: project
---
The Summer Project can say was the application of what learned in the ACA project, a step ahead of intensive coding for the gpu in CUDA based architecture. The same group as of ACA tackled the project under Professor Mahendra Verma. <!--more--> The project topic was to create a multigird solver for possions equation. The parallel regime was used to get the 3 dimension grid of unknown values in a jacobian iterator method (physics stuff).<br>The project was very important, as it made things clear about parallel programming and erased much of the doubts that had crept in the previous project.Very truely said, one must get into the swimming pool to know whether there are crocodiles in there :P.<br>
Contact me to know more about this.<br>
Here is the github link for the project<br>
