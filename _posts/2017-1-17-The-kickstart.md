Well I am a Student Guide and I got this question:
<br>
Question: What is the first thing one should try if you want to suceed in THE coding world ?
<br>
My "bachcha" asked me this question who is from the CSE Department. I knew that there is always a lot of
discussion and debate but a lack of proper consultation about it in the freshman as to what to start from. How to build up your coding skills
and compete among your batchmates ?
<!--more--> The starting moment makes a huge difference, believe me!
What, how and WHEN you start from is one of the most important learing aspects and difference
maker.<br>

What I will write is not something that I have tried myself while in college, but what I feel 
would have been best if done that way. So if you want a Kickstart, you can take hints from this
one.<br>

**Things To Do:**
<br>
Switch your operating system. Windows user? Days gone. Get yourself a <code>UNIX</code> based system. Laptops 
not allowed in first sem ? (really ?) But then you have the CC(Computer Center), roll with it. Learn the basics of UNIX based systems, this is important as you will be using Linux all your stay at IITK.
(No need to spend the whole time there barring you from Wing activities, do it slowly and steadily).
Next grab up some <code>html</code>, <code>javascript</code>, and <code>CSS</code> and use it in making a very simple homepage for yourself.
[See here for the details](http://www.iitk.ac.in/cc/homepage/).
Done ? Now comes the most important part. Get an account in <code>Codechef</code> or <code>Hackerrank</code>, they are 
competitive programming sites having large community of brilliant coders. Start solving the easy questions, this will help you in the 1st year
C Language course. Next comes <code>Git</code>, get an account in <code>github</code> and learn how to use it (My Suggestion: make your homepage by using github). The 
open source world belongs to it so you may love it there, moreover git will be required also all along your career life.
Till this is sufficient for your Kick Start, what you should remember is that you must 
practise things regularly in order to hone your skills. I know there will be people having done these already, 
for those people reading this, you all are at a step ahead from others, you may explore other unkown fields such as 
Parallel Programming, Machine Learning.. how ? (get to know your seniors!).<br>

**Things Not To Do:**
<br>
Well there is no restriction on things not to do... try out everything, thats the best way to learn!
But I would suggest only one thing to the freshmen: _Not to panic when things not go your way, relax and try learing things
from here, the days of mugging are gone._<br>

Also this was just my view of an ideal approach, I said already to only take hints from these things, new campus is left 
for your exploration !
