title: CUDA Project N Body Simulation
category: project
---
ACA(Association for Computer Activities) offers Computer Science students in their 2nd sem a group project. The topic that I got was(my first preference) "Learn parallel programming and make a face recognition app based on it". The project utilised the tremendous power of parallel programming in boosting the speed of such apps which ofcourse would be a failure in serial code.

We practised our way through the sem , working in udactiy, but we were short of time: to learn was too much and application designing would have pulled a lot of time. With discussion with our mentors, we decided to work in the new topic to create an "N-Body Simulator" which uses open AC too.<br>For those who dont know whats an N-Body Simulation, google it up beacuse its very interesting !<br>
The project was a successful one, we got well acquainted the working of gpu hardware and the parallel programming regime.<br>
Feel free to contact me for any updation.<br>
Here is the github link for the project<br>
